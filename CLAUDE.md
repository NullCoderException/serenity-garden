# Zen Garden Simulator - Project Overview

## Project Vision

A peaceful, web-based zen garden simulator where users can place, arrange, and interact with garden elements to create their own meditative space. The experience focuses on calm, deliberate interactions and aesthetic beauty rather than challenge or competition.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Phaser.js 3
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Build Tools**: Webpack
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Optional Backend**: Node.js with Express (for saving gardens)

## Core Features

1. **Garden Element Placement System**

   - Stones, plants, sand areas, water features
   - Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
   - Grid-based or free-form placement options

2. **Sand Manipulation**

   - Drawing patterns in sand areas
   - Different rake tools with unique pattern effects
   - Realistic sand displacement physics

3. **Environmental Effects**

   - Day/night cycle with lighting changes
   - Gentle weather effects (occasional rain, mist)
   - Ambient animations (leaves rustling, water rippling)

4. **Garden Interaction**

   - Zoom and pan controls
   - Object rotation and scaling
   - Meditation mode (purely observational)

5. **Progression System**
   - Unlockable garden elements
   - Achievement system for garden milestones
   - Garden templates and inspiration gallery

## Development Approach

This project will use an iterative development approach with the following phases:

### Phase 1: Core Engine

- Project setup with Phaser.js
- Basic rendering and camera controls
- Simple element placement system
- UI framework

### Phase 2: Garden Elements

- Implementation of different garden objects
- Basic interaction mechanics
- Sand area implementation
- Simple environmental effects

### Phase 3: Polish and Depth

- Enhanced visual effects
- Sound design and implementation
- Advanced interaction mechanics
- Save/load functionality

### Phase 4: Refinement

- User testing and feedback incorporation
- Performance optimization
- Additional content
- Deployment and sharing capabilities

## Integration with Claude Code

Claude Code will assist with:

- Generating component templates
- Implementing complex algorithms
- Debugging issues
- Creating procedural generation systems
- Optimizing performance bottlenecks

## Timeline

- **Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**: Project setup, basic rendering
- **Core Mechanics (Weeks 3-5)**: Element placement, basic interactions
- **Visual Enhancement (Weeks 6-8)**: Polish, effects, sound
- **Feature Completion (Weeks 9-10)**: Save/load, achievements
- **Testing & Deployment (Weeks 11-12)**: Refinement, publish

## Success Criteria

- Smooth, intuitive garden creation interface
- Visually appealing garden elements and effects
- Genuinely relaxing and meditative experience
- Stable performance across modern browsers
- Personal satisfaction with completed project

## Learning Goals

- Game development principles and patterns
- Phaser.js framework expertise
- Interactive design for meditative experiences
- Audio-visual programming for ambient experiences
- Game state management and persistence
