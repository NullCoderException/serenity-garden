## Project Start - [Add Date]

### Project Initialization

- Set up project structure
- Configured development environment
- Established documentation framework

### Initial Decisions

- Selected Phaser.js as the core framework for the following reasons:
  - Strong 2D rendering capabilities
  - Good documentation and community support
  - Built-in physics and animation systems
  - Suitable for web-based deployment
- Decided to focus on a zen garden theme to create a calming, meditative experience

### Goals for First Week

- Get basic Phaser.js project running
- Implement simple element placement system
- Create camera controls (pan/zoom)
- Set up project management structure

## January 25, 2025 - Initial Project Setup Complete

### Accomplishments
- Initialized npm project with Phaser.js 3.90.0
- Set up Webpack 5 with development server and hot reloading
- Created basic project structure with organized folders for scenes, objects, utils, and systems
- Implemented basic Phaser scene with placeholder garden visualization
- Added functional camera controls (right-click/middle-click pan, scroll zoom)
- Created placeholder asset generation system for initial development
- Set up proper git branching workflow

### Challenges
- Initial CopyWebpackPlugin error due to missing assets folder - resolved with .gitkeep
- Decided between grid-based vs free-form placement - will implement both options
- Camera bounds needed careful tuning to prevent users from getting lost

### Design Decisions
- Used Phaser.AUTO renderer for best browser compatibility
- Set 1280x720 as base resolution with responsive scaling
- Implemented placeholder asset generation to enable immediate development without art assets
- Camera controls use right/middle mouse to avoid conflicts with future left-click interactions
- Organized code structure to separate concerns (scenes, objects, systems)

### Learnings
- Phaser 3's camera system is quite powerful with built-in bounds and zoom
- Webpack 5 configuration is cleaner than previous versions
- Creating placeholder graphics programmatically speeds up prototyping significantly
- Important to set up proper project structure early to avoid refactoring later

### Next Steps
- Create GameObject base class for all garden elements
- Implement drag-and-drop system for element placement
- Design UI framework for element selection panel
- Add grid overlay toggle for precise placement
- Create first real garden elements (stones, plants)

## January 26, 2025 - TypeScript Conversion Complete

### Accomplishments
- Converted entire project from JavaScript to TypeScript
- Configured tsconfig.json with strict mode for maximum type safety
- Added proper type annotations to all game classes
- Created types directory with common interfaces (GardenElement, Position, etc.)
- Updated build pipeline to handle TypeScript compilation
- Added type-check scripts for continuous validation

### Benefits Realized
- Type safety now catches errors at compile time
- IntelliSense provides full Phaser API autocomplete
- Code is self-documenting with clear parameter and return types
- Refactoring is safer with TypeScript's type checking

### Technical Decisions
- Enabled strict mode in TypeScript for maximum safety
- Used explicit visibility modifiers (private/public) for class members
- Created dedicated types file for shared interfaces
- Prefixed unused parameters with underscore convention

### Next Steps
- Leverage TypeScript's type system for GameObject base class
- Create strongly-typed event system for element interactions
- Build type-safe UI components with proper interfaces

## January 26, 2025 - Core Systems Implementation

### Accomplishments
- Created GameObject base class with full TypeScript typing
- Implemented Draggable interface for interactive elements
- Built comprehensive drag-and-drop system with visual feedback
- Added snap-to-grid functionality with configurable grid size
- Created element state management system (idle, dragging, placed)
- Implemented UI panel for element selection and spawning
- Added visual grid overlay toggle for precise placement
- Integrated proper z-ordering for dragged elements
- Created Rock and Plant classes extending GameObject

### Challenges
- Coordinating between Phaser's input system and custom drag behavior
- Ensuring proper TypeScript types for all Phaser interactions
- Managing z-index properly during drag operations
- Balancing grid snapping with smooth drag feedback

### Design Decisions
- Used composition over inheritance with Draggable interface
- Implemented state pattern for element behavior management
- Created centralized UIManager for all UI elements
- Used Phaser's Graphics API for grid overlay rendering
- Separated concerns between game objects and UI components

### Learnings
- Phaser's input.dragDistanceThreshold helps prevent accidental drags
- TypeScript interfaces work beautifully for game object contracts
- Proper state management prevents edge cases in drag/drop
- Visual feedback (tint, scale) greatly improves UX
- Grid snapping needs visual indicators to be intuitive

### Next Steps
- âœ… Add rotation controls for placed elements  (COMPLETED)
- Implement collision detection between elements
- Create more garden element types (water features, sand areas)
- Add persistent storage for garden layouts
- Implement settings menu for grid size and other options

## June 29, 2025 - Element Rotation System Complete

### Accomplishments
- Added full rotation system to DraggableGameObject base class
- Implemented R key for clockwise rotation, Shift+R for counter-clockwise
- Created visual rotation indicator that shows selected element's orientation
- Added rotation step configuration (15 degrees by default)
- Integrated rotation controls with element selection system
- Updated UI controls text to document rotation features

### Technical Implementation
- Extended DraggableGameObject with rotation methods (rotate, rotateStep, setRotationStep)
- Added rotation indicator graphics that displays as green arrow showing current orientation
- Indicator updates in real-time when rotating elements
- Proper cleanup of rotation indicators on element deselection
- Used Phaser's radian/degree conversion utilities for smooth rotation

### Design Decisions
- 15-degree rotation steps provide good balance between precision and usability
- Green arrow indicator is clear but subtle, doesn't interfere with gameplay
- Shift modifier for counter-clockwise feels intuitive for users
- Rotation persists when elements are moved, providing expected behavior

### User Experience Improvements
- Visual feedback makes rotation state immediately obvious
- Keyboard controls are responsive and feel snappy
- Rotation works on all element types that extend DraggableGameObject
- No conflicts with existing camera or placement controls

### Next Steps
- Create sand pattern drawing system (core zen garden mechanic)
- Add plant elements with multiple variants
- Implement water features (ponds, fountains)
- Add element collision detection to prevent overlapping

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed rotation indicator not following elements during drag operations
- Improved visual clarity of rotation indicator with center dot and filled arrowhead

### [Example Entry] May 19, 2025 - Project Setup Complete

#### Accomplishments

- Initialized project with Webpack and Phaser
- Created basic scene structure
- Implemented simple camera movement
- Added placeholder assets for testing

#### Challenges

- Had difficulty with Webpack configuration for hot reloading
- Camera bounds needed adjustment to prevent scrolling out of bounds

#### Design Decisions

- Decided to use a component-based approach for garden elements
- Created a base class for all garden elements to inherit from
- Set up event system for element interaction

#### Learnings

- Discovered better ways to organize Phaser scenes
- Found useful resources on implementing grid-based placement systems
- Learned how to optimize asset loading in Phaser

#### Next Steps

- Implement basic sand area functionality
- Create first version of element placement UI
- Add simple stone elements with placement logic
