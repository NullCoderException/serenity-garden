## June 29, 2025 - Sand Pattern System Implementation

### Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive SandArea class as a new draggable garden element
- Implemented RakeSystem with 4 distinct rake types (Simple, Wide, Curved, Fine)
- Built sophisticated pattern drawing mechanics with real-time visual feedback
- Added tool mode switching between Placement and Rake modes
- Implemented keyboard controls for mode switching (T) and rake selection (1-4)
- Created grid-based pattern data storage for persistence
- Added visual pattern overlay that follows sand areas when dragged
- Successfully integrated sand areas with existing element management system

### Technical Details
- Used Phaser Graphics API for dynamic pattern rendering
- Implemented fixed-step interpolation for smooth rake strokes
- Created modular RakeSystem with configurable patterns
- Pattern data persists when sand areas are moved
- Different rake types provide unique visual effects

### Challenges
- TypeScript required careful property initialization for graphics objects
- Had to rename getLocalPoint to avoid base class conflicts
- Coordinating between placement and rake modes required state management

### Design Decisions
- Chose grid-based pattern storage for performance and simplicity
- Made rake patterns affect multiple grid cells for realistic width
- Used composition pattern for rake system extensibility
- Kept sand areas as draggable elements even with pattern overlays

### Major Redesign (Same Day)
After user feedback, completely redesigned the sand system to be more authentic:
- Replaced draggable SandArea elements with GardenSandLayer background
- Sand now covers the entire garden area as a foundation
- Stones and elements are placed ON TOP of the sand (proper zen garden design)
- Rake patterns draw directly on the garden background
- Fixed visual overlay issues and improved authenticity
- Updated UI text and interaction model to match new design

### Next Steps
- Add more sophisticated sand physics (displacement, smoothing)
- Implement pattern saving/loading with garden state
- Create additional rake patterns (circular, spiral)
- Add sound effects for sand raking
- Consider particle effects for sand displacement
- Add more element types (plants, water features)

## June 29, 2025 - Plant System Implementation

### Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive Plant element class with 5 distinct plant types
- Implemented subtle wind and growth animations for meditative experience
- Added plant palette with unique visual styling for each type
- Integrated plants seamlessly with existing element management system
- Fixed ElementManager update method to properly enable element animations
- Resolved rotation conflicts between user input and wind animation effects
- Added intelligent placement validation with plant-type-specific spacing rules

### Technical Details
- Plant types: SmallShrub, Tree, Flower, Grass, Bamboo with unique properties
- Wind animation uses sine waves with randomized phases for natural movement
- Growth animation provides subtle "breathing" scale effects
- Separate baseRotation tracking prevents wind animation from interfering with user rotation
- Type-specific scaling, origins, and collision detection for realistic garden placement
- State management includes all animation phases for proper save/load functionality

### Plant Types and Characteristics
- **SmallShrub**: Medium size, moderate wind sensitivity, garden staple
- **Tree**: Large scale, minimal wind movement, requires more spacing
- **Flower**: Small delicate, high wind sensitivity, bright pink coloring
- **Grass**: Smallest size, maximum wind movement, allows close placement
- **Bamboo**: Tall narrow, moderate wind, distinctive lime green

### Challenges Overcome
- Initial rotation conflict where wind animation overwrote user rotation
- Solved by implementing baseRotation property to separate user input from effects
- ElementManager required update method fix to properly call element animations
- Texture creation needed plant-type-specific naming for proper asset loading

### Design Decisions
- Chose continuous subtle animations over static elements for meditative quality
- Made different plant types have unique spacing requirements for realistic garden design
- Kept wind effects very subtle (0.02 radian max) to avoid distraction
- Used distinct colors for each plant type to improve visual differentiation
- Positioned plants in separate palette section to maintain clear UI organization

### Integration Success
- Plants work seamlessly with existing stone placement system
- Rotation (R/Shift+R) works perfectly with preserved wind animation
- Element selection, deletion, and drag-and-drop all function properly
- Grid snapping and collision detection work with plant-specific rules
- Example plants placed in garden demonstrate living garden aesthetic

### Next Steps
- Add water features with ripple effects and sound
- Implement save/load system for complete garden persistence
- Add ambient sound design for plants (wind through leaves, etc.)
- Create seasonal effects or plant growth progression
- Add more plant variants or decorative elements
- Optimize performance for larger gardens with many animated elements

<!-- Add your journal entries below as you progress through development -->

## January 25, 2025 - Initial Project Setup Complete

### Accomplishments
- Initialized npm project with Phaser.js 3.90.0
- Set up Webpack 5 with development server and hot reloading
- Created basic project structure with organized folders for scenes, objects, utils, and systems
- Implemented basic Phaser scene with placeholder garden visualization
- Added functional camera controls (right-click/middle-click pan, scroll zoom)
- Created placeholder asset generation system for initial development
- Set up proper git branching workflow

### Challenges
- Initial CopyWebpackPlugin error due to missing assets folder - resolved with .gitkeep
- Decided between grid-based vs free-form placement - will implement both options
- Camera bounds needed careful tuning to prevent users from getting lost

### Design Decisions
- Used Phaser.AUTO renderer for best browser compatibility
- Set 1280x720 as base resolution with responsive scaling
- Implemented placeholder asset generation to enable immediate development without art assets
- Camera controls use right/middle mouse to avoid conflicts with future left-click interactions
- Organized code structure to separate concerns (scenes, objects, systems)

### Learnings
- Phaser 3's camera system is quite powerful with built-in bounds and zoom
- Webpack 5 configuration is cleaner than previous versions
- Creating placeholder graphics programmatically speeds up prototyping significantly
- Important to set up proper project structure early to avoid refactoring later

### Next Steps
- Create GameObject base class for all garden elements
- Implement drag-and-drop system for element placement
- Design UI framework for element selection panel
