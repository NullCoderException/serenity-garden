## Project Start - [Add Date]

### Project Initialization

- Set up project structure
- Configured development environment
- Established documentation framework

### Initial Decisions

- Selected Phaser.js as the core framework for the following reasons:
  - Strong 2D rendering capabilities
  - Good documentation and community support
  - Built-in physics and animation systems
  - Suitable for web-based deployment
- Decided to focus on a zen garden theme to create a calming, meditative experience

### Goals for First Week

- Get basic Phaser.js project running
- Implement simple element placement system
- Create camera controls (pan/zoom)
- Set up project management structure

### [Example Entry] May 19, 2025 - Project Setup Complete

#### Accomplishments

- Initialized project with Webpack and Phaser
- Created basic scene structure
- Implemented simple camera movement
- Added placeholder assets for testing

#### Challenges

- Had difficulty with Webpack configuration for hot reloading
- Camera bounds needed adjustment to prevent scrolling out of bounds

#### Design Decisions

- Decided to use a component-based approach for garden elements
- Created a base class for all garden elements to inherit from
- Set up event system for element interaction

#### Learnings

- Discovered better ways to organize Phaser scenes
- Found useful resources on implementing grid-based placement systems
- Learned how to optimize asset loading in Phaser

#### Next Steps

- Implement basic sand area functionality
- Create first version of element placement UI
- Add simple stone elements with placement logic
