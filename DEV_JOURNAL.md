## Project Start - [Add Date]

### Project Initialization

- Set up project structure
- Configured development environment
- Established documentation framework

### Initial Decisions

- Selected Phaser.js as the core framework for the following reasons:
  - Strong 2D rendering capabilities
  - Good documentation and community support
  - Built-in physics and animation systems
  - Suitable for web-based deployment
- Decided to focus on a zen garden theme to create a calming, meditative experience

### Goals for First Week

- Get basic Phaser.js project running
- Implement simple element placement system
- Create camera controls (pan/zoom)
- Set up project management structure

## January 25, 2025 - Initial Project Setup Complete

### Accomplishments
- Initialized npm project with Phaser.js 3.90.0
- Set up Webpack 5 with development server and hot reloading
- Created basic project structure with organized folders for scenes, objects, utils, and systems
- Implemented basic Phaser scene with placeholder garden visualization
- Added functional camera controls (right-click/middle-click pan, scroll zoom)
- Created placeholder asset generation system for initial development
- Set up proper git branching workflow

### Challenges
- Initial CopyWebpackPlugin error due to missing assets folder - resolved with .gitkeep
- Decided between grid-based vs free-form placement - will implement both options
- Camera bounds needed careful tuning to prevent users from getting lost

### Design Decisions
- Used Phaser.AUTO renderer for best browser compatibility
- Set 1280x720 as base resolution with responsive scaling
- Implemented placeholder asset generation to enable immediate development without art assets
- Camera controls use right/middle mouse to avoid conflicts with future left-click interactions
- Organized code structure to separate concerns (scenes, objects, systems)

### Learnings
- Phaser 3's camera system is quite powerful with built-in bounds and zoom
- Webpack 5 configuration is cleaner than previous versions
- Creating placeholder graphics programmatically speeds up prototyping significantly
- Important to set up proper project structure early to avoid refactoring later

### Next Steps
- Create GameObject base class for all garden elements
- Implement drag-and-drop system for element placement
- Design UI framework for element selection panel
- Add grid overlay toggle for precise placement
- Create first real garden elements (stones, plants)

### [Example Entry] May 19, 2025 - Project Setup Complete

#### Accomplishments

- Initialized project with Webpack and Phaser
- Created basic scene structure
- Implemented simple camera movement
- Added placeholder assets for testing

#### Challenges

- Had difficulty with Webpack configuration for hot reloading
- Camera bounds needed adjustment to prevent scrolling out of bounds

#### Design Decisions

- Decided to use a component-based approach for garden elements
- Created a base class for all garden elements to inherit from
- Set up event system for element interaction

#### Learnings

- Discovered better ways to organize Phaser scenes
- Found useful resources on implementing grid-based placement systems
- Learned how to optimize asset loading in Phaser

#### Next Steps

- Implement basic sand area functionality
- Create first version of element placement UI
- Add simple stone elements with placement logic
